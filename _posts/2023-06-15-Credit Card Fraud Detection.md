## Abstract

Massive usage of credit cards has caused an escalation of fraud. Usage of credit cards has resulted in the growth of online business advancement and ease of the e-payment system. The use of machine learning (methods) are adapted on a larger scale to detect and prevent fraud. ML algorithms play an essential role in analysing customer data. In this research article, we have conducted a comparative analysis of the literature review considering the ML techniques for credit card fraud detection (CCFD) and data confidentiality. In the end, we have proposed a hybrid solution, using the neural network (ANN) in a federated learning framework. It has been observed as an effective solution for achieving higher accuracy in CCFD while ensuring privacy.
